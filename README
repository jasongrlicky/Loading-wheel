Firefox has two loading wheels. Neat idea, maybe we could improve these points:
* Pages that load fast show both and it's jarring.
* Wheels like and behave very different right now.
* No information about pages that have stalled loading.

Plan:
1) Create a live demo page showing off new animations and transitions
2) Make a prototype addon with the changes
3) Write a compelling blog post about what we did and why. Show common pageload scenarios.
